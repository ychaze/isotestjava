CHANGE LIST
-----------
The following is a list of changes that have been made in the 
Microsoft SQL Server JDBC Driver since the version 1.2 release in October 2007.

157330 The driver no longer deletes the incorrect number of records from a table 
       when the previous statement execution limited the number of rows.

182375 The driver now ensures that the com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException 
       class is serializable completely.

194672 The driver now correctly reconnects to Microsoft Distributed Transaction
       Coordinator (MS DTC) after the MSDTC service is restarted.

201162 The driver no longer throws an “Invalid TDS” exception when the application 
       sets the connection string property “selectMethod=cursor” and 
       executes a stored procedure that returns multiple consecutive empty result sets.

208164 Running the JDBC driver on IBM AIX platform no longer has a negative effect on
       performance.

129889 The SQLServerResultSetMetadata.getTableName method now correctly returns the
       table name.


KNOWN ISSUES
------------
The following are known issues with the Microsoft SQL Server JDBC Driver:


1) DRIVER LOAD CONFLICT WITH THE SQL SERVER 2000 JDBC DRIVER

If you load both the Microsoft SQL Server 2000 JDBC Driver and the
Microsoft SQL Server 2005 JDBC Driver (versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 2.0) in 
the same process, in some cases the 2000 version of the JDBC driver 
will incorrectly accept a DriverManager.getConnection method call that is targeted 
for the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 JDBC Driver (versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 2.0).

The problem is caused by the 2000 version of the JDBC driver
incorrectly accepting the "jdbc:sqlserver://" URL prefix if it is
loaded first.  

To work around this issue, load the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 JDBC Driver 
(versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 2.0) class first, as follows:

Class.forName("com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver"); // 2005 version
Class.forName("com.microsoft.jdbc.sqlserver.SQLServerDriver"); // 2000 version

This will ensure that the "jdbc:sqlserver://" URL prefix is handled
by the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 JDBC Driver (versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 2.0)
and the "jdbc:microsoft:sqlserver://" URL prefix is handled by the 2000 version 
of the JDBC driver.


2) LIMITATIONS GETTING PARAMETER METADATA FOR PREPARED STATEMENTS

There are some limitations when using the SQLServerParameterMetaData 
class with prepared statements. SQL INSERT statements require the optional
INTO clause and SQL DELETE statements require the optional FROM clause to
get the parameter metadata correctly.


3) SQL SERVER 2000 DATA CONVERSION LIMITATIONS

When using SQL Server 2000 with the JDBC driver, the following data
conversion limitations apply:

	- String data cannot be converted to an underlying money or
	  smallmoney column.
	- String data longer than 4000 characters can be converted
	  to char or varchar underlying columns if the
	  sendStringParametersAsUnicode connection string property is set
	  to false.


4) LIMITATIONS WITH NAMED PARAMETERS

Named parameters are not supported with stored procedures that contain
a left bracket "[" in their name. For example, a name like "stor[edProc".
Note that this does not affect the usual escaping of the stored procedure
names by using "[]".


5) XA TRANSACTION FAILURE ON WINDOWS XP

XA transactions will not work if SQL Server is running on Windows XP unless 
the following hotfix is applied:

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922668

Note this issue only applies when the SQL Server that is participating
in the XA transaction is running on Windows XP. Client applications 
running on Windows XP connecting to a remote SQL Server that is not 
running on Windows XP can participate in XA transactions. This issue
does not apply to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003.


6) SUN SOLARIS NEEDS GZIP TO INSTALL THE JDBC DRIVER

If installing the JDBC driver on a Sun Solaris computer, you may need to
first install GZIP in order to unzip the driver files. GZIP can be downloaded 
from www.gzip.org.


7) CONNECTION TIMEOUTS USING DATABASE MIRRORING

When you use the JDBC driver in a database mirroring configuration, the 
default connection timeout value is 0, which may result in indefinite 
connection attempts. Therefore, when you try to connect to a principal 
and mirror database that are both initially down, the JDBC driver will 
oscillate between each of the servers indefinitely until one gets back 
online. To escape from these infinite connection attempts, specify a 
finite value for the loginTimeout connection string property or incorporate
timeout logic into your application.


8) CONVERSION OF BIGDECIMAL VALUES

When you convert BigDecimal values to a string representation, the conversion
of those values depends on which version of the JVM that you are using. 

For example, the following code demonstrates these differences:

String str = new BigDecimal("1E10").toString();
System.out.println("String is " + str);
//with JVM 1.4 : prints out "String is 10000000000"
//with JVM 1.5 : prints out "String is 1E+10"

To achieve consistent behavior when it uses BigDecimal values, your application 
should use the BigDecimal.toPlainString method when running against JVM 1.5.


9) JDBC IPV6 CONNECTION BEHAVES INCONSISTENTLY WHEN USING INTEGRATED SECURITY

When using a numeric IPV6 address with integrated security, the connection 
may take longer to open or even fail. Integrated security connections to an 
IPV6 server will work as long as you use the machine name.


10) LARGE LIMIT VALUE FOR Reader.mark(readAheadLimit) IN ADAPTIVE MODE

In adaptive mode, if the application uses the java.io.Reader.mark(readAheadLimit) 
method to mark the position in a stream returned by the getter methods, 
an OutOfMemoryError might be thrown. This error may occur when the readAheadLimit 
is very large, such as Integer.MAX_VALUE. 

To work around this issue, set the readAheadLimit to a smaller value.


11) DATA TYPE CONVERSION FAILURE IN ADAPTIVE MODE

In adaptive mode, using getCharacterStream or getAsciiStream methods to retrieve 
character-valued ResultSet columns or CallableStatement OUT parameters might throw 
an OutOfMemoryError. This error occurs when a data type conversion is necessary for 
the value. For example, retrieving an ntext column data type by using the 
getAsciiStream method or a varchar(max) column data type by using the 
getCharacterStream method requires a data type conversion.

To work around this issue, use the appropriate stream-getter method for that data type.


12) AVOID CREATING TEMPORARY TABLES via PreparedStatement or CallableStatement CLASSES

If the application creates temporary tables via PreparedStatement or CallableStatement 
when executing a query, these temporary tables may be dropped after the query executes.

To work around this issue, either execute such queries by using the Statement class or; 
if you must use the PreparedStatement class or the CallableStatement class, 
create a table in the database and delete that table when it is no longer needed.


13) RESET STREAM PARAMETERS BEFORE RE-EXECUTING A PREPARED STATEMENT
 
Executing a SQLServerPreparedStatement might consume java.io.InputStream and 
java.io.Reader parameter values that were set by using the following methods: 
setAsciiStream, setBinaryStream, setCharacterStream, setNCharacterStream, 
setBlob, setClob, setNClob, or setObject. 

If you want to re-execute the same prepared statement and use the same 
InputStream or Reader streams again, first you must reset the streams 
by using the java.io.InputStream.reset method or the java.io.Reader.reset method. 
Then, you must set the affected parameter values by using the appropriate 
SQLServerPreparedStatement.set<Type> method. 

Otherwise, an SQLServerException will be thrown while re-executing 
the same prepared statement. This is expected behavior defined by the JDBC specification.
 

14) AVOID USING THE SAME STREAM FOR MULTIPLE PARAMETERS WHEN EXECUTING A PREPARED STATEMENT
 
If the same stream is used by multiple parameters in the same PreparedStatement object,
an SQLServerException will be thrown.  You must use a different stream for each parameter.
This is expected behavior defined by the JDBC specification.
