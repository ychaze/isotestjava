    <p>Operations in a relational database act on a complete set of rows. The set of rows returned by a SELECT statement consists of all the rows that satisfy the conditions in the WHERE clause of the statement. This complete set of rows returned by the statement is known as the result set. Applications cannot always work effectively with the entire result set as a unit. These applications need a mechanism to work with one row or a small block of rows at a time. Cursors are an extension to result sets that provide that mechanism. </p>
    <p>Cursors extend result set processing by doing the following:</p>
    <ul><li>
        Allowing positioning at specific rows of the result set.<br />
      </li><li>
        Retrieving one row or block of rows from the current position in the result set.<br />
      </li><li>
        Supporting data modifications to the row at the current position in the result set.<br />
      </li><li>
        Supporting different levels of visibility to changes made by other users to the database data that is presented in the result set.<br />

    <p>The JDBC specification provides support for forward-only and scrollable cursors that are sensitive or insensitive to changes made by other jobs, and can be read-only or updatable.

      <p xmlns="">The TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, TYPE_SS_DIRECT_FORWARD_ONLY, and TYPE_SS_SERVER_CURSOR_FORWARD_ONLY cursors support only the <a href="60248447-6908-4036-a779-a501453cd553.htm">next</a> positioning method.</p>
      <p xmlns="">The TYPE_SS_SCROLL_DYNAMIC cursor does not support the <a href="638e8148-8ca0-4e1f-9ec2-04a11bc9809b.htm">absolute</a> and <a href="a266e3bc-05c2-44e2-9346-125ae6780216.htm">getRow</a> methods. The <b>absolute</b> method can be approximated by a combination of calls to the <a href="67ed9447-7b10-4c87-98e7-f4c2e2470b3a.htm">first</a> and <a href="2bcdbb69-95fd-4ae8-8488-1a75a91fe2e0.htm">relative</a> methods for dynamic cursors.</p>
      <p xmlns="">The <b>getRow</b> method is supported by TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, TYPE_SS_DIRECT_FORWARD_ONLY, TYPE_SS_SERVER_CURSOR_FORWARD_ONLY, TYPE_SS_SCROLL_KEYSET, and TYPE_SS_SCROLL_STATIC cursors only. The <b>getRow</b> method with all forward-only cursor types returns the number of rows read so far through the cursor.</p>
      <div style="margin: .5em 1.5em .5em 1.5em" xmlns=""><b>Note: </b>
        When an application makes an unsupported cursor positioning call, or an unsupported call to the <b>getRow</b> method, an exception is thrown with the message, "The requested operation is not supported with this cursor type."<p />
      </div>
      <p xmlns="">Only the TYPE_SS_SCROLL_KEYSET and the equivalent TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE cursors expose deleted rows. If the cursor is positioned on a deleted row, column values are unavailable, and the <a href="9c6db315-e614-4604-b020-41af6a214cc1.htm">rowDeleted</a> method returns "true". Calls to <b>get&lt;Type&gt;</b> methods throw an exception with the message, "Cannot get value from a deleted row". Deleted rows cannot be updated. If you try to call an <b>update&lt;Type&gt;</b> method on a deleted row, an exception is thrown with the message, "A deleted row cannot be updated". The TYPE_SS_SCROLL_DYNAMIC cursor has the same behavior until the cursor is moved out of the current fetch buffer.</p>
      <p xmlns="">Forward and dynamic cursors expose deleted rows in a similar way, but only while the cursors remain accessible in the fetch buffer. For forward cursors, this is fairly straightforward. For dynamic cursors it more complex when the fetch size is greater than 1. An application can move the cursor forward and backward within the window that is defined by the fetch buffer, but the deleted row will disappear when the original fetch buffer in which it was updated is left. If an application does not want to see transient deleted rows by using dynamic cursors, a fetch relative (0) should be used.</p>
      <p xmlns="">If the key values of a TYPE_SS_SCROLL_KEYSET or TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE cursor row are updated with the cursor, the row retains its original position in the result set, regardless of whether the updated row meets the cursor’s selection criteria. If the row was updated outside the cursor, a deleted row will appear at the row’s original position, but the row will appear in the cursor only if another row with the new key values was present in the cursor, but has since been deleted. </p>
      <p xmlns="">For dynamic cursors, updated rows will retain their position within the fetch buffer until the window that is defined by the fetch buffer is left. Updated rows might subsequently reappear at different positions within the result set, or might disappear completely. Applications that have to avoid transient inconsistencies in the result set should use a fetch size of 1 (the default is 8 rows with CONCUR_SS_SCROLL_LOCKS concurrency and 128 rows with other concurrencies).</p>
    </content></div><h1 class="heading">Cursor Conversion</h1><div id="sectionSection1" class="section"><content xmlns="http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5">
      <p xmlns="">
        SQL Server can sometimes choose to implement a cursor type other than the one requested, which is referred to as an implicit cursor conversion (or cursor degradation). For more information about implicit cursor conversion, see the "Using Implicit Cursor Conversions" topic in SQL Server Books Online.</p>
      <p xmlns="">With SQL Server 2000, when you update the data through the <b>ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE</b> and <b>ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE</b> result set, an exception is thrown with a message "The cursor is READ ONLY". This exception occurs because the SQL Server 2000 has done an implicit cursor conversion for that result set and did not return the updatable cursor that has been requested.</p>
      <p xmlns="">To work around this problem, you can do one of the following two solutions:</p>
      <ul xmlns=""><li>
          Ensure that the underlying table has a primary key<br />
        </li><li>
          Use <a href="d87afd89-3e75-402c-b844-1b434eb258df.htm">SQLServerResultSet.TYPE_SS_SCROLL_DYNAMIC</a> instead of <b>ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE</b> while creating a statement.<br />
        </li></ul>
    </content></div><h1 class="heading">Cursor Updating</h1><div id="sectionSection2" class="section"><content xmlns="http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5">
      <p xmlns="">In-place updates are supported for cursors where the cursor type and concurrency support updates. If the cursor is not positioned on an updatable row in the result set (no <b>get&lt;Type&gt;</b> method call succeeded), a call to an <b>update&lt;Type&gt;</b> method will throw an exception with the message, "The result set has no current row." The JDBC specification states that an exception arises when an update method is called for a column of a cursor that is CONCUR_READ_ONLY. In situations where the row is not updatable, such as because of an optimistic concurrency conflict such as a competing update or deletion, the exception might not arise until <a href="363d1008-1396-4fc0-8e27-c9ba2499e7f1.htm">insertRow</a>, <a href="cfced0ca-a281-40dc-8d2f-370d5f0bf12b.htm">updateRow</a>, or <a href="aa04a644-c7c2-4738-8b6e-7fea566d2c16.htm">deleteRow</a> is called.</p>
      <p xmlns="">After a call to <b>update&lt;Type&gt;</b>, the affected column cannot be accessed by <b>get&lt;Type&gt;</b> until <b>updateRow</b> or <a href="2ecacca4-f7bc-4f5d-886a-da7747fdccae.htm">cancelRowUpdates</a> has been called. This avoids problems where a column is updated by using a different type from the type returned by the server, and subsequent getter calls could invoke client side type conversions that give inaccurate results. Calls to <b>get&lt;Type&gt;</b> will throw an exception with the message, "Updated columns cannot be accessed until updateRow() or cancelRowUpdates() has been called."</p>
      <div style="margin: .5em 1.5em .5em 1.5em" xmlns=""><b>Note: </b>
        If the <b>updateRow</b> method is called when no columns have been updated, the JDBC driver will throw an exception with the message, "updateRow() called when no columns have been updated."<p />
      </div>
      <p xmlns="">After <a href="f3c54bfe-d5b7-4f6e-ae6c-3e8954e5b1c9.htm">moveToInsertRow</a> has been called, an exception will be thrown if any method other than <b>get&lt;Type&gt;</b>, <b>update&lt;Type&gt;</b>, <b>insertRow,</b> and cursor positioning methods (including <a href="9a7c754c-2d72-4207-b3bd-2afc6047fb3d.htm">moveToCurrentRow</a>) are called on the result set. The <b>moveToInsertRow</b> method effectively places the result set into insert mode, and cursor positioning methods terminate insert mode. Relative cursor positioning calls move the cursor relative to the position it was at before <b>moveToInsertRow</b> was called. After cursor positioning calls, the eventual destination cursor position becomes the new cursor position.</p>
      <p xmlns="">If the cursor positioning call made while in insert mode does not succeed, the cursor position after the failed call is the original cursor position before <b>moveToInsetRow</b> was called. If <b>insertRow</b> fails, the cursor remains on the insert row and the cursor remains in insert mode.</p>
      <p xmlns="">Columns in the insert row are initially in an uninitialized state. Calls to the <b>update&lt;Type&gt;</b> method set the column state to initialized. A call to the <b>get&lt;Type&gt;</b> method for an uninitialized column throws an exception. A call to the <b>insertRow</b> method returns all the columns in the insert row to an uninitialized state.</p>
      <p xmlns="">If any columns are uninitialized when the <b>insertRow</b> method is called, the default value for the column is inserted. If there is no default value but the column is nullable, then NULL is inserted. If there is no default value and the column is not nullable, the server will return an error and an exception will be thrown.</p>
      <div style="margin: .5em 1.5em .5em 1.5em" xmlns=""><b>Note: </b>
        <p />
        Calls to the <b>getRow</b> method returns 0 when in insert mode. <p />
        The JDBC driver does not support positioned updates or deletes. According to the JDBC specification, the <a href="3f3ec4f2-103a-4e16-9206-c5bd8639f946.htm">setCursorName</a> method has no effect and the <a href="e5b3af67-423a-4551-a4c6-a4bc076bd504.htm">getCursorName</a> method will throw an exception if called. <p />
        Read-only and static cursors are never updatable. <p />
        SQL Server restricts server cursors to a single result set. If a batch or stored procedure contains multiple statements, then a forward-only read-only client cursor must be used.<p />

      <p xmlns="">Any result set for which a SQL Server cursor type is indicated in the above table buffers up to the number of rows specified by the <a href="233bf4f8-4758-42d0-a80b-33e34fa78027.htm">setFetchSize</a> method of the <a href="eaffcff1-286c-459f-83da-3150778480c9.htm">SQLServerResultSet</a> object. The Microsoft SQL Server 2005 JDBC Driver version 1.2 or later ignores the value of the <b>responseBuffering</b> setting in such cases, except the case where the application overrides the <b>responseBuffering</b> setting as specified in the TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY (CONCUR_UPDATABLE) case. In such a case, the application can override the <b>responseBuffering</b> setting by calling the <a href="9f489835-6cda-4c8c-b139-079639a169cf.htm">setResponseBuffering</a> method of the <a href="ec24963c-8b51-4838-91e9-1fbfa2347451.htm">SQLServerStatement</a> object with a <b>String</b> value "<b>adaptive"</b>.</p>
